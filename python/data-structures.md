# Data structures

## Built-in sequences

Container sequences: list, tuple, collections.deque (hold items of different types - references to the objects)
Flat sequences: str, bytes, bytearray, memoryview, array.array (hold items of one type - physically store the values of each item)

By mutability:
Mutable sequences: list, bytearray, array.array, collections.deque, memoryview
Immutable sequences: tuple, str, bytes
